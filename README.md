# binary-search-tree
Binary Search Tree Implementation. Implementation of an ordered binary tree. A binary search tree has the advantage of cutting the search time in half each time it moves through a node (as long as it is a fairly balanced tree). And in the business world, speed is important. Less time spent searching data is more time for the mainframe to do other important tasks.\
